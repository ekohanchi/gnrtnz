<div class="headingstyle">What is the cost of gnrtn Z coaching?</div>
<div class="bodystyle">
The price for each coaching session is for one hour of individual instruction. Parents do not pay for the travel 
time by Coaches to and from the sessions, or interactions between the Students and Coaches before and after each session (e.g. progress reports). 
The cost for each session starts at $50/hour and may be higher for premium level Coaches.  Coaches set their own hourly rates, and gnrtn Z receives a set 
fee based on the hourly rate. All payments are made online through a secure web application to prevent fraud and protect information. 
</div>

<div class="headingstyle">Where does the coaching session take place?</div>
<div class="bodystyle">
Coaching sessions occur at a location arranged by the Parents and Students. Parents and Students are expected to provide basic equipment and materials. 
gnrtn Z is in the process of partnering with schools and community centers to offer their sites for coaching sessions.
<br/><br/>
gnrtn Z will begin matching Coaches with Students in LA, CA in the Fall of 2011. If you want gnrtn Z in your city,
